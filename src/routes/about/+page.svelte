	<h1>About 'another sudoku clone'</h1>

	<p>
		This is a <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">SvelteKit</a> app. In fact, it's my first ever project
		developed using Svelte so save your criticisms for another day since the code structure's horrible.
	</p>

	<p>
		<a href="https://github.com/johngohrw/sudoku-solver">Here's the repo</a> for this project. Mind that
		despite it being named "sudoku solver", there's isnt any solver mechanism (yet). My original plans
		were much more ambitious -- having thought of programming a solver algorithm (which seemed easy in
		my head), I wanted a solver that worked on a playable board, and not just on an unplayable read-only
		board.
	</p>

	<p>
		Hence, what you see here would be the base for the solver. I will update this section once I
		eventually get around to implement it.
